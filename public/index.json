It\u0026rsquo;s been fun doing as it has exposed me to many challenges with memory management, context switches on LLM\u0026rsquo;s, etc. I enjoy hiking, the outdors and nature never fail to ground me. I love dogs, had a beautiful labrador called Daga (RIP, I still think about you!), and animals in general. And watching movies and tv shows, last one I watched was Yellowstone. It surprised me how quickly I got hooked on it since the first couple of episodes did nothing for me.
