## Hello, I'm Ignacio ðŸ‘‹

What's up? This is sort of a personal thing that I wanted to do for a while.
Create a personal website with zero expectations of it being anything but a little project I might abandon in a couple of months for the next shiny thing. 
I will mainly use this thing to write about what peaks my interest at any given time.
Do not expect anything special from this one, and you won't be dissapointed.

### My Skills
Languages come and go, depending where I am at I will be able to code more in one or another.
After not touching a language for months I tend to chatgpt my way through for loops.
- **Languages**: ["Python", "Golang", "Dart"]
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: ["Flutter", "Cobra", "Viper"]
- **Tools & Technologies**: ["Jenkins", "Kubernetes", "ArgoCD", "Terraform"]
- **Soft Skills**: ["Project lead", "Basically love engaging with people"]

### Personal Interests

Besides the obvious spending time with family and friends, lately I am having a lot of fun building a chatbot for a group chat with some of my fellow Madridistas.
It's been fun doing as it has exposed me to many challenges with memory management, context switches on LLM's, etc.
I enjoy hiking, the outdors and nature never fail to ground me.
I love dogs, had a beautiful labrador called Daga (RIP, I still think about you!), and animals in general.
And watching movies and tv shows, last one I watched was Yellowstone. It surprised me how quickly I got hooked on it since the first couple of episodes did nothing for me. Very much worth a watch.
